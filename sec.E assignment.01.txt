1.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science
 which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, 
gradually improving its accuracy.
2.
 Machine learning algorithms have had good results on problems such has spam detection in email,
 cancer diagnosis, fraudulent credit card transactions, and automatically driving vehicles.
3.
A training set is a portion of a data set used to fit (train) a model for prediction or
classification of values that are known in the training set, but unknown in other (future) data.
 The training set is used in conjunction with validation and/or test sets that are used to evaluate different models.
4.
Two most common supervised tasks are classification and regression.
5.
Four common unsupervised tasks inclused clustering, 
visualization, dimensionality reduction , and association rule learning.
6.
The best Machine Learning algorithm to allow a robot to walk in unknown terrain is Reinforced Learning, 
where the robot can learn from response of the terrain to optimize itself.
7.
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm method.
 In layman terms, it finds all of the different “clusters”
 and groups them together while keeping them as small as possible.
 That means that you end up with the most possible customer segments to interpret.
8.
The data. Spam detection is a supervised machine learning problem. This means to provide
 the machine learning model with a set of examples of spam and ham messages
 and let it find the relevant patterns that separate the two different categories.
